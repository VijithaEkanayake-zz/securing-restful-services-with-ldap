# Securing RESTful Services with LDAP

In this guide you will learn about integrating external LDAP to a service that enforces authentication and 
authorization checks using Ballerina.

The following are the sections available in this guide.

- [What you'll build](#what-youll-build)
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Developing the service](#developing-the-service)
- [Testing](#testing)
- [Deployment](#deployment)
- [Observability](#observability)

## What you’ll build
To understanding how you can secure a RESTful web service using Ballerina, let’s continue to secure the web service you created in "RESTful Service" Ballerina by Guide.

The following figure illustrates all the functionalities of the OrderMgt RESTful web service, that should be secured.

![RESTful Service](images/restful-service.svg "RESTful Service")

- **Create Order** : Order creation should be allowed for all the users. Authentication or authorization should not be enforced for this function.
- **Retrieve Order** : Retrieval of the order details should only be allowed for authenticated users.
- **Update Order** : Updating order details should only be allowed for "admin" users.
- **Delete Order** : Deletion of the order should only be allowed for "admin" users.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 1.8 or later
- [Ballerina Distribution](https://github.com/ballerina-lang/ballerina/blob/master/docs/quick-tour.md)
- A Text Editor or an IDE
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- To provide required LDAP user store for this guide, we have created a docker image with an embedded Apache DS which contains the user details that should be used in authentication and authorization. we will use the following LDAP schema, which creates two users. The 'counter' user only has 'add_order' scope, whereas the 'admin' user has 'add_order', 'update_order' and 'cancel_order' scopes. Here scopes are equivalent to LDAP groups. Follow the intruction to setup LDAP server neccessory for the guide.
- Execute the following command to pull docker image from the docker hub.
```bash
docker pull vijithaekanayake/embedded_ldap_server:1.0.0
```
- After pulling the docker image, execute below command to start the LDAP server.
```bash
docker run -d -p 9389:9389 vijithaekanayake/embedded_ldap_server:1.0.0
```

### Optional requirements
- Ballerina IDE plugins ([IntelliJ IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9520-ballerina), [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WSO2.Ballerina), [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-ballerina))

## Developing the service

- We can get started with a Ballerina service; 'OrderMgtService', which is the RESTful service that serves the order management request. We will look at securing multiple resources exposed by OrderMgtService to match with the different security requirements.

- Although the language allows you to have any package structure, use the following package structure for this project to follow this guide. The root directory will be denoted by `SAMPLE_ROOT` in the context of this README.

```
secure-restful-service
  └── guide
      └── secure-restful_service
          ├── secure_order_mgt_service.bal
          └── test
              └── secure_order_mgt_service_test.bal 
      └── ballerina.conf
```

- Once you created your package structure, go to the <SAMPLE_ROOT>/guide directory and run the following command to initialize your Ballerina project.

```bash
   $ ballerina init
```

 - The above command will initialize the project with a `Ballerina.toml` file and `.ballerina` implementation 
 directory that contain a list of packages in the current directory.
 
 - `LdapAuthProviderConfig` record provides the required set of fields for the LDAP integration. Given configurations
  are aligned with the provided embedded LDAP server to demonstrate the scenario.

- Add the following content to your Ballerina service, which is the service created in "RESTful Service" Ballerina by Guide, but with authentication and authorization related annotation attributes added to the service and resource configuration. `authentication` is enabled in `authConfig` attribute of `ServiceConfig`. Therefore, authentication will be enforced on all the resources of the service. However, since we have overridden the `authentication` enabled status to 'false' for `findOrder` functionality, authentication will not be enforced for `findOrder`.

```
- Ballerina uses 'scope' as the way of expressing authorization. Multiple scopes can be assigned to a user, and scopes can then be validated while enforcing authorization. In order to express that certain service or resources require a scope, we have used the `scopes` annotation attribute. According to the `authConfig` of the service, in order to invoke `addOrder` function, the user should have 'add_order' scope, whereas to invoke `updateOrder` and `cancelOrder` user should have 'update_order' and 'cancel_order' scopes respectively.

## Testing

### Invoking the RESTful service

You can run the RESTful service that you developed above, in your local environment. You need to have the Ballerina installation in you local machine and simply point to the <ballerina>/bin/ballerina binary to execute all the following steps.  

1. As the first step you can build a Ballerina executable archive (.balx) of the service that we developed above, 
using the following command. It points to the directory in which the service we developed above located and it will create an executable binary out of that. Navigate to the `<SAMPLE_ROOT>/guide/` folder and run the following command.

```bash
$ ballerina build secure_restful_service
```

2. Once the secure_order_mgt_service.balx is created inside the target folder, you can run that with the following command.

```bash
$ ballerina run target/secure_restful_service.balx
```

3. The successful execution of the service should show us the following output.

```bash
$ ballerina run target/secure_restful_service.balx

ballerina: initiating service(s) in 'target/secure_restful_service.balx'
ballerina: started HTTP/WS endpoint 0.0.0.0:9090
```

4. You can test authentication and authorization checks being enforced on different functions of the OrderMgt RESTFul service by sending HTTP request. For example, we have used the curl commands to test each operation of OrderMgtService as follows.

**Create Order - Without authentication**

```
curl -kv -X POST -d \
'{ "Order": { "ID": "100500", "Name": "XYZ", "Description": "Sample order."}}' \
"https://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order" -H "Content-Type:application/json"

Output :  
< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
< content-type: text/plain
< content-length: 38
< server: ballerina/0.970.0-beta0
< date: Tue, 24 Jul 2018 15:32:39 +0530

Authentication failure
```

**Create Order - Authenticating as 'counter' user**

```
curl -kv -X POST -u counter:ballerina -d \
'{ "Order": { "ID": "100500", "Name": "XYZ", "Description": "Sample order."}}' \
"https://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order" -H "Content-Type:application/json"

Output :  
< HTTP/1.1 201 Created
< Content-Type: application/json
< Location: http://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order/100500
< content-length: 46
< server: ballerina/0.980.2-SNAPSHOT
< date: Tue, 24 Jul 2018 15:33:06 +0530

{"status":"Order Created.","orderId":"100500"}
```

**Retrieve Order - Without authentication**

Authentication is disabled for `findOrder` operation. Therefore, the following request will succeed.

```
curl -k "https://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order/100500"

Output :
{"Order":{"ID":"100500","Name":"XYZ","Description":"Sample order."}}
```

**Update Order - Without authentication**
```
curl -k -X PUT -d '{ "Order": {"Name": "XYZ", "Description": "Updated order."}}' \
"https://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order/100500" -H "Content-Type:application/json"

Output:
Authentication failure
```

**Update Order - Authenticating as 'counter' user**

Authorization check for `updateOrder` operation requires the 'update_order' scope. The 'counter' user only has 'add_order' scope. Therefore, the following request will fail.

```
curl -k -X PUT -u counter:ballerina -d '{ "Order": {"Name": "XYZ", "Description": "Updated order."}}' \
"https://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order/100500" -H "Content-Type:application/json"

Output:
Authorization failure
```

**Update Order - Authenticating as 'admin' user**
```
curl -k -X PUT -u admin:ballerina -d '{ "Order": {"Name": "XYZ", "Description": "Updated order."}}' \
"https://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order/100500" -H "Content-Type:application/json"

Output:
{"Order":{"ID":"100500","Name":"XYZ","Description":"Updated order."}}
```

**Cancel Order - Authenticating as 'admin' user**
```
curl -k -u admin:ballerina -X DELETE "https://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order/100500"

Output:
"Order : 100500 removed."
```

### Writing unit tests

In Ballerina, the unit test cases should be in the same package inside a folder named as 'tests'. The naming convention should be as follows,

* Test functions should contain test prefix.
  * e.g.: testResourceAddOrder()

This guide contains unit test cases for each resource available in the 'order_mgt_service.bal'.

>Note: Make sure that embedded LDAP server is up and running prior to running the unit tests.

To run the unit tests, navigate to the `<SAMPLE_ROOT>/guide/` directory and run the following command.
```bash
   $ ballerina test
```

To check the implementation of the test file, refer to the [secure_order_mgt_service_test.bal](https://github.com/ballerina-guides/securing-restful-services-with-basic-auth/blob/master/guide/secure_restful_service/tests/secure_order_mgt_service_test.bal).

## Deployment

Once you are done with the development, you can deploy the service using any of the methods that we listed below.

### Deploying locally
You can deploy the RESTful service that you developed above, in your local environment. You can use the Ballerina executable archive (.balx) archive that we created above and run it in your local environment as follows.

```
$ ballerina run target/secure_restful_service.balx
```

### Deploying on Docker


You can run the service that we developed above as a docker container. As Ballerina platform offers native support for running ballerina programs on
containers, you just need to put the corresponding docker annotations on your service code.

- In our OrderMgtService, we need to import  `` import ballerinax/docker; `` and use the annotation `` @docker:Config `` as shown below to enable docker image generation during the build time.

- Then execute `docker ps` command in the terminal and take corresponding Docker process id for the LDAP server. 
Then execute execute `docker ps <PROCESS_ID>` and take IP address of the LDAP server container.

```
   $ docker ps
```

```
   $ docker inspect <PROCESS_ID>
```

- Then update the LDAP connectionURL of LdapAuthProviderConfig with the LDAP server container IP address

##### secure_order_mgt_service.bal
```ballerina
package secure_restful_service;

import ballerina/auth;
import ballerina/http;
import ballerinax/docker;

// Configuration options to integrate Ballerina service
// with an LDAP server

    // Unique name to identify the user store
    domainName: "ballerina.io",
    // Connection URL to the LDAP server
    connectionURL: "ldap://<IP_ADDRESS_OF_LDAP_SERVER_CONTAINER>:9389",
    // The username used to connect to the LDAP server
    connectionName: "uid=admin,ou=system",
    // Password for the ConnectionName user
    connectionPassword: "secret",
    // DN of the context or object under which
    // the user entries are stored in the LDAP server
    userSearchBase: "ou=Users,dc=ballerina,dc=io",
    // Object class used to construct user entries
    userEntryObjectClass: "identityPerson",
    // The attribute used for uniquely identifying a user entry
    userNameAttribute: "uid",
    // Filtering criteria used to search for a particular user entry
    userNameSearchFilter: "(&(objectClass=person)(uid=?))",
    // Filtering criteria for searching user entries in the LDAP server
    userNameListFilter: "(objectClass=person)",
    // DN of the context or object under which
    // the group entries are stored in the LDAP server
    groupSearchBase: ["ou=Groups,dc=ballerina,dc=io"],
    // Object class used to construct group entries
    groupEntryObjectClass: "groupOfNames",
    // The attribute used for uniquely identifying a group entry
    groupNameAttribute: "cn",
    // Filtering criteria used to search for a particular group entry
    groupNameSearchFilter: "(&(objectClass=groupOfNames)(cn=?))",
    // Filtering criteria for searching group entries in the LDAP server
    groupNameListFilter: "(objectClass=groupOfNames)",
    // Define the attribute that contains the distinguished names
    // (DN) of user objects that are in a group
    membershipAttribute: "member",
    // To indicate whether to cache the role list of a user
    userRolesCacheEnabled: true,
    // Define whether LDAP connection pooling is enabled
    connectionPoolingEnabled: false,
    // Timeout in making the initial LDAP connection
    ldapConnectionTimeout: 5000,
    // The value of this property is the read timeout in
    // milliseconds for LDAP operations
    readTimeout: 60000,
    // Retry the authentication request if a timeout happened
    retryAttempts: 3
};

http:AuthProvider basicAuthProvider = {
    id: "basic01",
    scheme: http:AUTHN_SCHEME_BASIC,
    authStoreProvider: http:AUTH_PROVIDER_LDAP,
    authStoreProviderConfig: ldapAuthProviderConfig
};

@docker:Config {
    registry:"ballerina.guides.io",
    name:"secure_restful_service",
    tag:"v1.0"
}
@docker:Expose{}
endpoint http:Listener listener {
    port:9090,
    secureSocket: {
        keyStore: {
            path: "${ballerina.home}/bre/security/ballerinaKeystore.p12",
            password: "ballerina"
        },
        trustStore: {
            path: "${ballerina.home}/bre/security/ballerinaTruststore.p12",
            password: "ballerina"
        }
    },
    authProviders: [basicAuthProvider]
};

// Order management is done using an in memory map.
// Add some sample orders to 'orderMap' at startup.
map<json> ordersMap;

@Description {value:"RESTful service."}
@http:ServiceConfig {basePath:"/ordermgt"}
service<http:Service> order_mgt bind listener {
```

- Now you can build a Ballerina executable archive (.balx) of the service that we developed above, using the following command. It points to the service file that we developed above and it will create an executable binary out of that.
This will also create the corresponding docker image using the docker annotations that you have configured above. Navigate to the `<SAMPLE_ROOT>/src/` folder and run the following command.  

```
   $ ballerina build secure_restful_service --skiptests

   Run following command to start docker container:
   docker run -d -p 9090:9090 ballerina.guides.io/secure_restful_service:v1.0
```

- Once you successfully build the docker image, you can run it with the `` docker run`` command that is shown in the previous step.  

```   
   docker run -d -p 9090:9090 ballerina.guides.io/secure_restful_service:v1.0
```

  Here we run the docker image with flag`` -p <host_port>:<container_port>`` so that we  use  the host port 9090 and the container port 9090. Therefore you can access the service through the host port.

- Verify docker container is running with the use of `` $ docker ps``. The status of the docker container should be shown as 'Up'.
- You can access the service using the same curl commands that we've used above.

```
   curl -kv -X POST -u counter:ballerina -d '{ "Order": { "ID": "100500", "Name": "XYZ", "Description": "Sample order
   ."}}' \
   "https://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
```

### Deploying on Kubernetes

- You can run the service that we developed above, on Kubernetes. The Ballerina language offers native support for running a ballerina programs on Kubernetes,
with the use of Kubernetes annotations that you can include as part of your service code. Also, it will take care of the creation of the docker images.
So you don't need to explicitly create docker images prior to deploying it on Kubernetes.   

- We need to import `` import ballerinax/kubernetes; `` and use `` @kubernetes `` annotations as shown below to enable kubernetes deployment for the service we developed above.

> NOTE: Linux users can use Minikube to try this out locally.

- Make sure to update the LDAP connectionURL of LdapAuthProviderConfig with the LDAP server container IP address

##### order_mgt_service.bal

```ballerina
package secure_restful_service;

import ballerina/auth;

- Here we have used ``  @kubernetes:Deployment `` to specify the docker image name which will be created as part of building this service.
- We have also specified `` @kubernetes:Service {} `` so that it will create a Kubernetes service which will expose the Ballerina service that is running on a Pod.  
- In addition we have used `` @kubernetes:Ingress `` which is the external interface to access your service (with path `` /`` and host name ``ballerina.guides.io``)

If you are using Minikube, you need to set a couple of additional attributes to the `@kubernetes:Deployment` annotation.
- `dockerCertPath` - The path to the certificates directory of Minikube (e.g., `/home/ballerina/.minikube/certs`).
- `dockerHost` - The host for the running cluster (e.g., `tcp://192.168.99.100:2376`). The IP address of the cluster can be found by running the `minikube ip` command.

- Now you can build a Ballerina executable archive (.balx) of the service that we developed above, using the following command. It points to the service file that we developed above and it will create an executable binary out of that.
This will also create the corresponding docker image and the Kubernetes artifacts using the Kubernetes annotations that you have configured above.

```
   $ ballerina build secure_restful_service --skiptests

   Run following command to deploy kubernetes artifacts:  
   kubectl apply -f ./target/kubernetes/secure_restful_service
```

- You can verify that the docker image that we specified in `` @kubernetes:Deployment `` is created, by using `` docker images ``.
- Also the Kubernetes artifacts related our service, will be generated in `` ./target/secure_restful_service/kubernetes``.
- Now you can create the Kubernetes deployment using:

```
   $ kubectl apply -f ./target/kubernetes/secure_restful_service

   deployment.extensions "ballerina-guides-secure-restful-service" created
   ingress.extensions "ballerina-guides-secure-restful-service" created
   secret "listener-secure-socket" created
   service "ballerina-guides-secure-restful-service" created
```

- You can verify Kubernetes deployment, service and ingress are running properly, by using following Kubernetes commands.

```
   $ kubectl get service
   $ kubectl get deploy
   $ kubectl get pods
   $ kubectl get ingress
```

- If everything is successfully deployed, you can invoke the service either via Node port or ingress.

Node Port:

```
curl -kv -X POST -u counter:ballerina -d \
'{ "Order": { "ID": "100500", "Name": "XYZ", "Description": "Sample order."}}' \
"https://<Minikube_host_IP>:<Node_Port>/ordermgt/order" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
```


## Observability
Ballerina is by default observable. Meaning you can easily observe your services, resources, etc.
However, observability is disabled by default via configuration. Observability can be enabled by adding following configurations to `ballerina.conf` file in `secure-restful-service/src/`.

```ballerina
[observability]

[observability.metrics]
# Flag to enable Metrics
enabled=true

[observability.tracing]
# Flag to enable Tracing
enabled=true
```

### Tracing
You can monitor ballerina services using in built tracing capabilities of Ballerina. We'll use [Jaeger](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger) as the distributed tracing system.
Follow the following steps to use tracing with Ballerina.

- Run Jaeger docker image using the following command
```bash
   docker run -d -p5775:5775/udp -p6831:6831/udp -p6832:6832/udp -p5778:5778 -p16686:16686
   -p14268:14268 jaegertracing/all- in-one:latest
```

- Navigate to `secure-restful-service/src/` and run the 'secure_restful_service' program using following command
```
   $ ballerina run secure_restful_service/
```

- Observe the tracing using Jaeger UI using following URL
```
   http://localhost:16686
```

- You should see the Jaeger UI as follows

   ![Jaeger UI](images/tracing-screenshot.png "Tracing Screenshot")


### Metrics
Metrics and alarts are built-in with ballerina. We will use Prometheus as the monitoring tool.
Follow the below steps to set up Prometheus and view metrics for Ballerina restful service.

- Set the below configurations in the `ballerina.conf` file in the project root, in addition to the user related configuration.
```ballerina
   [observability.metrics.prometheus]
   # Flag to enable Prometheus HTTP endpoint
   enabled=true
   # Prometheus HTTP endpoint port. Metrics will be exposed in /metrics context.
   # Eg: http://localhost:9797/metrics
   port=9797
   # Flag to indicate whether meter descriptions should be sent to Prometheus.
   descriptions=false
   # The step size to use in computing windowed statistics like max. The default is 1 minute.
   step="PT1M"
```

- Create a file `prometheus.yml` inside `/etc/` location. Add the below configurations to the `prometheus.yml` file.
```
   global:
   scrape_interval:     15s
   evaluation_interval: 15s

   scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'prometheus'

   static_configs:
        - targets: ['172.17.0.1:9797']
```

   NOTE : Replace `172.17.0.1` if your local docker IP differs from `172.17.0.1`

- Run the Prometheus docker image using the following command
```
   docker run -p 19090:9090 -v /tmp/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus
```

- You can access Prometheus at the following URL
```
   http://localhost:19090/
```

- Promethues UI with metrics for secure_restful_service

   ![promethues screenshot](images/metrics-screenshot.png "Prometheus UI")

### Logging
Ballerina has a log package for logging to the console. You can import ballerina/log package and start logging. The following section will describe how to search, analyze, and visualize logs in real time using Elastic Stack.

- Start Elasticsearch using the following command
```
   docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -it -h elasticsearch --name
   elasticsearch docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.2.2
```

   NOTE: Linux users might need to run `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144` to increase `vm.max_map_count`

- Start Kibana plugin for data visualization with Elasticsearch
```
   docker run -p 5601:5601 -h kibana --name kibana --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch
   docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:6.2.2     
```

- Configure logstash to format the ballerina logs

    i) Create a file named `logstash.conf` with the following content

    ```
    input {
        beats {
           port => 5044
        }
    }

    filter {
        grok  {
            match => {
                "message" => "%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:date}%{SPACE}%{WORD:logLevel}%{SPACE}
                \[%{GREEDYDATA:package}\]%{SPACE}\-%{SPACE}%{GREEDYDATA:logMessage}"
            }
        }
    }

    output {
        elasticsearch {
            hosts => "elasticsearch:9200"
            index => "store"
            document_type => "store_logs"
        }
    }
    ```

    ii) Save the above `logstash.conf` inside a directory named as `{SAMPLE_ROOT_DIRECTORY}\pipeline`

    iii) Start the logstash container, replace the {SAMPLE_ROOT_DIRECTORY} with your directory name

    ```
    docker run -h logstash --name logstash --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch -it --rm
        -v ~/{SAMPLE_ROOT_DIRECTIRY}/pipeline:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/
        -p 5044:5044 docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:6.2.2
    ```

 - Configure filebeat to ship the ballerina logs

     i) Create a file named `filebeat.yml` with the following content
    ```
    filebeat.prospectors:
      - type: log
    paths:
      - /usr/share/filebeat/ballerina.log
    output.logstash:
        hosts: ["logstash:5044"]
    ```
     ii) Save the above `filebeat.yml` inside a directory named as `{SAMPLE_ROOT_DIRECTORY}\filebeat`   


     iii) Start the logstash container, replace the {SAMPLE_ROOT_DIRECTORY} with your directory name

    ```
    docker run -v {SAMPLE_ROOT_DIRECTORY}/filebeat/filebeat.yml:/usr/share/filebeat/filebeat.yml
        -v {SAMPLE_ROOT_DIRECTORY}/src/secure_restful_service/ballerina.log:/usr/share/filebeat/ballerina.log
        --link logstash:logstash docker.elastic.co/beats/filebeat:6.2.2
    ```

 - Access Kibana to visualize the logs using following URL
```
http://localhost:5601
```

 - Kibana log visualization for the restful service sample
